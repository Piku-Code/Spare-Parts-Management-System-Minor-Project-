# Spare-Parts-Management-System-Minor-Project-
I developed this Spare Parts Management system using Java Swing &amp; Awt Package in Netbeans 15 Tool and also use the oracle 21c database for store data.

First you have to create create table in database and connect them.
first table ---- 
create_user file data is login verified data.
secound table ----
inventry data tab.
third table ---
inventry user table data.
